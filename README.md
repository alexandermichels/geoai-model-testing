# geoai-model-testing
Set of example models to test with HPC resources and CyberGIS Compute

Included are:
- Basic linear NN
- Basic CNN with MNIST dataset
- Image segmentation model from PyTorch
- Basic GNN

- sbatch script template for use with the keeling hpc cluster

Aim to fine tune, test with keeling, and then set up for CyberGIS Compute
